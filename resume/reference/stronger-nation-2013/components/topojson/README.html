<h1 id="topojson">TopoJSON</h1>
<p><strong>TopoJSON</strong> is an extension of GeoJSON that encodes topology. Rather than representing geometries discretely, geometries in TopoJSON files are stitched together from shared line segments called <em>arcs</em>. TopoJSON eliminates redundancy, offering much more compact representations of geometry than with GeoJSON; typical TopoJSON files are 80% smaller than their GeoJSON equivalents. In addition, TopoJSON facilitates applications that use topology, such as <a href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/simplify/">topology-preserving shape simplification</a>, <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/4188334">automatic map coloring</a>, and <a href="http://prag.ma/code/d3-cartogram/">cartograms</a>.</p>
