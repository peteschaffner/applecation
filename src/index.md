# Dear Apple,

My name is Pete Schaffner. I specialize in interface/interaction design,
animation and front-end engineering, and I would love the opportunity to do my
life's best work with you.

I'm a technical and self-driven individual and I believe that to design something
great you need to understand the materials and processes involved to build it.
Thus, I'm just as at home with a pencil as I am with a terminal. I also believe
that the tools we use are important and they are in as much need for good design as the things
they create.

I've compiled some of my work and experiences here, though unfortunately I am
unable to share much of what I've been doing lately at my current employer.
Please feel free to look around and let me know if you have any questions.

I look forward to hearing from you,
