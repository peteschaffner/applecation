# Dear Apple,

My name is Pete Schaffner. I'm an American werewolf in Paris. I specialize in
interface/interaction design, animation, frontend engineering and howling at the
moon.

I have a penchant for tinkering and believe that to create something great you
need to understand the materials and processes involved to build it. Thus, I'm
just as at home with a pencil as I am with a terminal prompt. I also believe
that the tools we use are in just as much need of good design as the things
they create. From programming languages and APIs, to IDEs, everything needs a
considered touch.
