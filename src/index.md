# Dear Apple,

My name is Pete Schaffner. I specialize in interface/interaction design,
animation and frontend engineering, and I want to work with you.

I have a penchant for tinkering and believe that to create something great you
need to understand the materials and processes involved to build it. Thus, I'm
just as at home with a pencil as I am with a terminal. I also believe
that the tools we use are in just as much need of good design as the things
they create, all the way from programming languages and APIs, up to IDEs.
