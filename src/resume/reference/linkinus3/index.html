      <p class="tagline">A concept for version 3 of the premier IRC client for OS X.</p>
    </header>

    <section id="meat">
      <h2 id="primer">Primer</h2>
      <p>As you look through the mockups below, you will notice that I tried to 
      imagine how a 2-pane Linkinus might work. I have always felt claustrophobic 
      while using any 3-paned app (yes, this includes Chocolat). For those that 
      feel the same, I thought it might be nice to offer users an option as 
      to where the "User list" would be docked. I will stick to this layout for 
      the remainder of these comps.</p>

      <h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
      <figure><img src="1.png" alt="Groups"></figure>
      <p>Groups are one of the features that sets your app apart, so I thought 
      it would be best to make the creating/managing of them a key part of the 
      UI.</p>
      <p>The titlebar has been made thick, in order to accommodate buttons and 
      other elements, and this is where the "Groups list" and "Group creator" 
      buttons could live. The image below shows how the group manager, 
      brought front and center in the UI, could live in a popup window. By 
      taking group management out of the Preference pane, and into the main 
      window, it will hopefully make for a smoother experience. The "Group 
      creator", (or plus sign button) could be a quick way to slice up the chat 
      view (I imagine holding the &#x2325; modifier would insert a vertical 
      split, rather than a horizontal). From here you could drag queries/channels 
      in and build your perfect grouping.</p>

      <h2 id="inline-images">Inline images</h2>
      <figure><img src="3.png" alt="Inline image"></figure>
      <p>Another wonderful feature in Linkinus is the ability to view linked 
      images inline. These next two mockups show how inline media might be 
      treated&hellip; where "breaks" in the flow of messages would show glimpses 
      of the linked image. Clicking on the area would unfold the full-sized image 
      in all its beauty.</p>
      <p>It would be great to see the same kind of functionality for video, and 
      audio.</p>

      <h2 id="splits">4-way split</h2>
      <figure><img src="5.png" alt="4-way split"></figure>
      <p>Here we have a 4-way split, with one section ready to be populated.</p>
      <p>In this particular mockup, the text input is stationary, as my gut 
      tells me that positioning inputs relative to their respective chat section 
      would be jarring for the user. I would, however, like to mockup 
      an alternative, just to see what it would feel like, as I'm not fully 
      convinced this is the right solution.</p>
      <p>P.S. I am doing these designs on my MBA, thus the constrained window 
      size ;)</p>

      <h2 id="add-channel">Adding channels</h2>
      <figure><img src="6.png" alt="Adding channels"></figure>
      <p>The comp above illustrates a popover interface for discovering new 
      channels based on a keyword search. I am not sure if their is a ranking 
      system for the quality of IRC channels, but Nicholas mentioned ratings 
      in the Kickoff task, so this accounts for that situation.</p>

      <h2 id="user-list">User list</h2>
      <figure><img src="8.png" alt="Alternate user list as a popover"></figure>
      <p>This mockup shows an alternate user list that lives in a popover.</p>
      <p>This concept needs a little more work, seeing as I would like to use 
      popovers for the user info windows, and a popover off of another popover 
      seems like bad news bears.</p>
