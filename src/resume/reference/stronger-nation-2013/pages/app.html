        <p>The United States risks an unprecedented shortage of college-educated workers in coming years. With the global economy demanding more and more highly skilled workers, economists and labor experts say increasing college attainment is a national imperative.</p>

        <p>That’s why Lumina is part of a growing movement to increase the higher education attainment rate of the United States to 60 percent by the year 2025. We must work harder — and faster — to reach Goal 2025. Increasing the nation’s college attainment rate is critical if we hope to sustain the vitality of our local communities and the nation’s economy.</p>

      <div id="metro-copy" class="wrap">
        <p>There is no doubt that cities and metropolitan regions <i>must</i> be prime locations for action in the drive to increase college attainment. According to Census figures, more than 80 percent of Americans live in cities or suburbs. And with demographic trends showing that American society is becoming increasingly urban, it is obvious that the nation must find effective strategies to increase college attainment in metropolitan regions.</p>
        <p>What’s more, we at Lumina believe these areas are fertile ground for growing the kind of collaborations among political, business, education, philanthropic and community-based leaders that can have significant impact on college attainment. That is why we are focusing much of our attention on large-scale change in metropolitan regions.</p>
        <p>We are already supporting such efforts in dozens of metro regions. Our partners in this work understand that creating an educated workforce is a vital survival strategy for a city; they recognize that a well-educated person more actively embraces his or her role as a contributing citizen.</p>
        <p>In short, a metro-region strategy taps a strong motivation and sense of urgency for the change that is necessary to achieve Goal 2025 and secure the future of the country as a whole. But it all starts with understanding where you are (knowing your region’s data) and setting a goal for where you need to be. We hope the data provided here can put more cities and metropolitan regions on that strategic path.</p>
