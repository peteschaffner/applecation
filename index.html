  <main class=" about ">
  <h1 id="hello-apple-">Hello Apple,</h1>
<p>My name is Pete Schaffner. I specialize in interface and interaction design,
animation and front-end engineering. I would love to use these skills in
Cupertino to do my life’s best work.</p>
<p>I’m a technical and self-driven individual and I believe that to design
something great you need to understand the materials and processes involved to
build it.  Thus, I’m just as at home with a pencil as I am with a terminal. I
also believe that the tools we use are important and that they are in as much
need of good design as the things they create.</p>
<p>I’ve compiled here some of my work and experiences for you to review, but
unfortunately I am unable to share much of what I’m currently up to.
Nonetheless, I hope this little site and its contents can somewhat speak to my
abilities.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
